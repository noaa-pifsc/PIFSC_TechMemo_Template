Acknowledgments here. For example, this template is possible in part through
NMFS Open Science, an encouraging, supportive, and ambitious group of people
working to remove barriers in our scientific workflows.  This effort was further 
made possible by PIFSC's technical editor Revere Wood.

This template makes generous use of existing open resources, which are recognized
throughout the template as they're used.  If any are pivotal to the creation of 
your data report, please recognize them appropriately.
