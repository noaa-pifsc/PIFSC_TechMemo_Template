# Delete this page in Word {.unnumbered}
Along with the page before it that the template generates.

Before that, though, follow these instructions in Word:  

- Add in captions for any figures and tables you have  

- At the top of the Table of Contents, select Insert > Break > "Section Break
(continuous)"   

- At the top of the first section after your Executive Summary, do the same
thing: Insert > Break > "Section Break (continuous)"  

- From your Table of Contents page, select Insert > Page Numbers.  Select 
"Alignment" to be "Right".  Then, click on "Format" and select lower-case Roman 
numerals.  

- On an odd-numbered page, click in the footer area and insert the following 
footer (font size 11):  
\
U.S. Department of Commerce | National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  
\
- On an even-numbered page, insert the following footer (font size 11):  
\
National Marine Fisheries Service | Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center  
\

Then, follow the instructions on the following pages:  
- Table of Contents  
- List of Tables  
- List of Figures

# There's some suggested text below which you can modify to fit your situation.

# Code: It's preferable to link a publicly accessible GitHub repository that is
# devoted solely to this publication and allows people to replicate your work.

# Data: There are a lot of permutations on how shareable data are.  Here are three
# cases to help guide you.  If you're unsure about what to do with your data, 
# ask for help from your supervisor, our PIFSC data officer (Jenny Suter), or a 
# member of the PIFSC Open Science community.  There are resources available, 
# but it can sometimes be hard to track them down.
#
# Confidential data: If you signed an NDA to access the data you used, then you
# should have a good sense of whether it's confidential.  If it is, and you're
# therefore not allowed to share it, here's text you can use for the data
# availability statement.  Adjust it to reference your dataset in InPort.
#    Fisheries data used in this paper are subject to confidentiality of 
#    information requirements under the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
#    Management Act (Magnuson–Stevens Act or MSA) and are not available to the 
#    public except in summary aggregate form. Information on requesting access to 
#    these data can be found at https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/2721 
#    (logbook data) and https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/5610 (dealer
#    data).   
#
# Already-public data: If all of the data you used are already publicly available
# and it's possible to recreate your results using your code, then all you need 
# to do is point people to where you got the data.
#    We thank NOAA Coral Reef Watch for providing the SST data  
#    (https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_sst.php). We thank

# Original data: If your publication uses new or non-public, non-confidential 
# data, you should provide information on how readers can access the data.  If 
# you collected the data, you'll need to archive it and make it accessible. First, 
# regardless of the data type, you should create and link to an 
# InPort (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/) record.  InPort provides public 
# metadata (data about data).  It does not serve the actual data.  To do that,
# there are many options that largely depend on the type of data:
#    - Geolocated environmental data (e.g., CTD data) should be archived with
#      NCEI.  There have options for stand-alone collections and ongoing 
#      collections.  See their sites for more information: 
#      One-time submission: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/archive/send2ncei/
#      Ongoing collection: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/archive/atrac/index.html
#    - Genomic data: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ If you're familiar
#      with archiving genomic data, please open an issue or submit a pull request
#      to contribute your expertise.
#    - Coral reef data: https://www.coris.noaa.gov/ If you're familiar with 
#      archiving coral reef data, please open an issue or submit a pull request
#      to contribute your expertise.
#    - Other data types: Zenodo is a NMFS-approved archival site that will accept
#      pretty much any kind of data.  It will provide a citeable DOI for your 
#      data which you can use as the URL in the data availability text below.  See
#      their site for more information: https://zenodo.org/
#      A Zenodo tutorial is also in the works for the ReadMe of this repo.  Keep
#      an eye out for that.  
#    - Know of a category/archive that should be included in this list?  Please
#      open an issue or submit a pull request to have it added.  Thanks for 
#      helping to make this template better!
# 
# Data available upon request: If you choose to include a statement to the effect
# of, "Data available from the authors upon request," please consider including
# an email address for the lead author and/or additional authors.  One thing to
# consider with this approach is that if you leave NOAA, readers will be unable
# to request the data from you.

# Table of Contents
**In Word, follow these directions and then delete this text.** To add the table 
of contents, add a line below the following paragraph, select Insert > Index and 
Tables… and select “Table of Contents”.  Unselect “Use hyperlinks instead of 
page numbers.”  Click “Okay”.  

To auto-generate the table of contents, highlight the table of contents and 
click “Update Table” in the top-left corner. If you want Headings 3 visible in 
the ToC, or if you don’t want Headings 2 visible: go to References > Table of 
Contents > look at the bottom of the drop-down menu and click “Custom Table of 
Contents” > keep everything the same except increase or decrease “levels”; to 
show more headings: show three levels; to show less headings: show two levels > 
click “Yes” on the pop-up asking to replace TOC. Make sure the new TOC have the 
dotted lines.

# List of Tables
**In Word, follow these directions and then delete this text.** To update the 
pre-inserted List of Tables (note: since there are no properly formatted figures 
present in the document, the list shows up as “No table of figures entries 
found”): highlight the table > go to References > Captions > click “Update 
Table” > click “update entire table”.  

If you need to auto-generate a new List of Tables: go to the References tab > 
Captions > insert Table of Figures > check “Caption Label” is set to “Figures” 
in the pop-up menu > press “OK”. Do this process after figures have been 
inserted into document. If your captions are not auto-generating, ensure you 
have followed proper steps for inserting captions found on pages b and c.

# List of Figures
